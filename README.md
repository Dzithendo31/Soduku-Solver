# Soduku-Solver
In this Repo we'll use machine learning techniques to actual solve the different suduku 
The Goal is to have user upload an image(clear one) and give them the solution prediction.

#Attempt 001 - Munangiwa
The idea is to use an Artifcial Neutral network, given a (labeled)dataset of Soduku problems and their solution, give them to the Network for it to learn how to actual solve the Soduku.
The dataset has be a pretty large dataset, but because of lack of resourse we might have to generate one our selves or get assistance(AI)
